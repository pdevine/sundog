\section{Overview}

The original SunDog: Frozen Legacy was a critically acclaimed space trading
game written for the Apple II and Atari ST line of computers in the early
to mid 1980's.  The game centers on a young man, Zed, who inherits his
uncle's battered and beaten space ship the SunDog.  Unfortunately for Zed, his
uncle has an outstanding contract which needs to be fulfilled before clear
title to the ship can be had.

The contract that Zed needs to fulfill is a tall order.  His uncle has made a
deal to deliver goods to a shadowy religious group which is building a
colony on the planet Jondd.  The game begins with Zed onboard the
SunDog without knowing the location of the colony, little money and not
much else.  If Zed is going to keep the SunDog, he's going to have to learn
a lot, quickly.

SunDog: Resurrection will refresh Frozen Legacy and give it a more modern
look and appearance while maintaining the spirit of the original.  The 
original SunDog had a unique feel and depth of gameplay which was 
unprecedented in the early 1980s.
