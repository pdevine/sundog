About the functional spec
-------------------------

The functional spec is written using latex, a typesetting language, which
makes it easy to do revision control (since it's entirely text based).

To compile it you'll need pdflatex, which on OSX is included in the texlive
distribution of LaTeX.  On Ubuntu or Debian linux you can probably just
apt-get install it.  For Windows, I don't have any idea, however if you
figure it out you can always modify this file with directions.

On OSX, I use the following command to compile:

/usr/local/texlive/2008basic/bin/universal-darwin/pdflatex sundog.tex
